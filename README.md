K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Project

Overview

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks, focusing on understanding how proximity-based learning can accurately predict class labels. KNN is a simple, yet effective, algorithm used in various applications such as recommendation systems and image recognition.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Normalized data for improved accuracy.
Model Training and Testing: Used KNN with different values of k to evaluate model performance.
Evaluation: Analyzed accuracy and other metrics to optimize the model.
Requirements
Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, and Pandas.
Usage
Clone the repository.
Run KNN Model.ipynb to train and test the model.
